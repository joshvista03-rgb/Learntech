# LearnTech (Static Demo)

A simple static demo of a learning site with:
- Login/Logout (client-side demo only)
- Progress bar (+20% per lesson)
- Rewards system (+10 points)
- One-question quiz (adds points when correct)
- Persistence using `localStorage` per user

> **Note:** This is a front-end only demo (no real database). The login is hardcoded: `admin / 1234`.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repo (e.g., `learntech-site`) on GitHub.
2. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` (or upload the ZIP and extract in the repo).

4. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` / `/root`
5. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/learntech-site/`.

## Local Testing
